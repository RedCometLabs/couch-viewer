## Yowzer

Welcome to *Yowzer*, your Couchdb view app to compliment Futon. I love Couchdb, but found Futon a bit limited in functionality. 
So I wrote *Yowzer* to add those features. 

## Install

By default running `grunt` will install Yowzer into your local Couchdb instance. Edit the grunt.js file and change the db path

## Development

`grunt watch` will watch for changes and re-deploy couchdb for quicker development testing
